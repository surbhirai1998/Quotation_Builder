# Quotation_Builder

This web based application is used to create quotations for the company. 
It has an option of adding new clients. Editing costs per service and changing the deatils as required.
It generates a pdf file after all the details have been entered, the editing of this file is easy as the details can be edited any time.
The file can be downloaded and it gets saved by a default file name (client based).

### For this I have used :
J2EE - servlets and jsps.
iTextPdf 5.1

Front end technologies like - HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap
